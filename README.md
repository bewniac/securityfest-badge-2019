# Security fest 2019 - Official badge
Here you go, all the code and files that exist as a part of the official Security fest badge "N00Badge". First of all you should know that I'm a complete newbie and this is my first ever project designing a PCB from scratch. I've learned a lot and it was a lot of fun with more headaches. I recommend everyone wanting to get into electronics to do exactly this, get an idea what you want to do and do it!

All the schematics and PCB design files are made in [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/) which is an Open Source Electrionics design suite and there is a lot of footprints and schematic symbols for a lot of components out there. You could choose to go with Eagle, I haven't tried it but heard a lot of nice things about it. I choose KiCAD because it was the first google result.
